# No-BS-Sales-Enablement_V2

A minimal repository for the "No-BS Sales Enablement" — Essential Sales Playbook Builder.

## Files added
- `LICENSE` (MIT)
- `.gitignore`
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Importing to Lovable
Lovable typically imports repositories that include a build definition (for example a `Dockerfile` at the repo root) or standard language files such as `package.json` or `requirements.txt` so it can detect the correct buildpack.

If you'd like, I can add a basic `Dockerfile` and a GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish an image to GHCR or Docker Hub — tell me which registry you prefer.

## Usage
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines and local setup notes.
